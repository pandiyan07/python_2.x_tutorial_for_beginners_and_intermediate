List of all sorting and searching algorithms :-

Sorting algorithms :-

*	selection sort - relies on the repeated selection of the next smallest item
*	merge sort - which relies on repeated merging of selections of the list that are sorted
*	insertion sort - other algorithms for sorting list
*	bubble sort - "
*	heap sort- "
*	quick sort -"
*	shell sort -"
* 	timsort - it is the default sorting algorithm python programming language

--> performs the sorting task for restricted kinds of values
*	counting sort -  which relies on the values belonging to a small set of items
*	 bucket sort -  relies on the ability to map each value to one of a small set of items.
*	radix sort -  relies on the values being sequences of digits.

Searching algorithms :-
*	 linear search
*	binary search
