7 tips to write simple python code

(1) use the enumerate function

cities=['chennai','coiambatore','tirupur','erode']

for i,city in enumerate(cities):
	print(i,city)

(2) use the zip function to walk through two lists

x_list=[1,2,3]
y_list-[2,3,6]

for x,y in zip(x_list,y_list):
	print(x,y)

(3) swapping value can be done without a temporoary variable

x=4
y=5

x,y=y,x    #it is said to be a tuple unpacking
print "After:x=%d, y="%d"%(x,y)


(4) use get function in a dictionary to get the value orelse prompting the function to return some default value .

ages={'mary':43,'superman':54}

age=ages.get('pandi','Unknown')
# if the pandi element is not found in the dictionary then unknown is returned.

print'pandiyan is %s year old'

(5) else can be used in for loop

needle='d'
haystack=['a','b','c','d']

for letter in haystack:
	if needle==letter:
		print'Found !'
		break
else:
	print'not found'

(6) no need to use read function and store the file contents in a variable and no need to use  close function in a file .
use context , using the with statement you can read and write a file

with open('sample.txt') as f:
	for line in f:
		print line


(7)  exception also can use else statement

print'converting!'

try:
	print int'x')
except:
	print'Conversion failed !'
else:
 print'Conversion successful !'
finally:
	print'Done !'

# finally statement is no need in general but if the above code does not have except and else statement
	and you want to print out something even when your code throws a error , then you have to use finally 
	statemetent
