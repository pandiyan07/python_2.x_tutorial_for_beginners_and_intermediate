A very good evening folks and i wish you all had very nice day today ? well Iam S.T.R Pandiyan and iam studying in third year computer
science engineering in the sasurie college of engineering and my goal is to become a hacker and one day i will be one ofcourse . 
as a initial step iam starting to code and iam starting to focus on the web languages and other basic languages like C and C++.
as most of you don't know that a hacker must be knowing these types of languages and on further to learn a advanced language , iam
focusing on the python language and iam working on it as hard as i can.so that i will have a good grasp on this language.
hope that i will soon be getting to know these languages in well .
and yeah please wish me a best of luck . see yeah..!!
