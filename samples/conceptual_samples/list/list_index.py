# this is a sample python script program which is used to demonstrate the concept of :
# printing of index values of list elements by using the list comprehension concept in python.

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
b=[i for i,x in enumerate(a) if x==3]
# the list a's comprehension is stored in the b in the above line of code
# and it is been printed below
print b

# this is the end of the python program . happy coding ..!!
