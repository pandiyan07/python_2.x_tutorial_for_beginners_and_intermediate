# this is a sample python script program which is created to demonstrate the concept of list comprehension.

list_one=[2,3,4]
list_two=[2*i for i in list_one if i>2] # the list comprehension is used here
# the first 2*i is the body that is to be executed after checking the two conditional statements situated after it.
# the for loop in the second place is the first condition
# and the if loop in the third place is the second condition
print list_two

# this is the end of the program file. happy coding..!!
